This is some experiementation with SLMs using Ollama on my local machine. It's an NLP example using a SLM to try and interpret text in several news reports on the web. The news reports are about data breaches and I have a series of 9 questions I'm asking. 
I'm using the Olama framework with three downloaded models.
It works, but it's really slow on my laptop. SLMs really need a more powerful machine than my laptop!
